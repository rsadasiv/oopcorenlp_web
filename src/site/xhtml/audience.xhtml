		<p>
			oopcorenlp_web is an extensible web application that allows users to browse, interact, visualize, and analyze oopcorenlp output.
		</p>
		<p>
			The front end has been tested on recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.<br/>
			Some visualizations require a lot of pixels. Don't try to run this on your phone.<br/>
			Some endpoints return raw JSON. Installing a browser plugin such as JSON Formatter will make reading these responses in the browser much more pleasant.<br/>
			Some JSON documents can be quite large. A stand-alone JSON tool such as Huge JSON Viewer will make navigating full documents outside the webapp much more pleasant.<br/>
